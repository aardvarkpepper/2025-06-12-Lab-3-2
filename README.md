# Reflection

After completing these challenges, take a few minutes to answer the following questions:

How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

I often got element size, spacing, and configuration specifications direcly from Figma, rather than having to spend time tinkering and guessing.  I did style fonts according to the style guide though.

With the first challenge, I set text exactly as specified in the Figma style guide but didn't get the results I wanted.  I ended up tinkering with margins a bit to reproduce the sample.

Community resources and feedback can always help improve a developer - not just that on Frontend Mentor.  Resources can save time looking things up and/or give insight into industry standards.  Feedback can give insight into things that a developer wouldn't think of on their own.
