# Reflection

After completing these challenges, take a few minutes to answer the following questions:

How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

I lifted element size and spacing specifications pretty near-directly from Figma.
